### Implement the Painting Canvas:

   Create a new Swift file called `DrawingCanvas.swift` and add the following code:

   ```swift
   import SwiftUI

   struct DrawingCanvas: View {
       @State private var lines: [Line] = []
       @State private var currentLine: Line = Line(points: [])
       @State private var selectedColor: Color = .black
       @State private var lineWidth: CGFloat = 4.0

       var body: some View {
           VStack {
               HStack {
                   Button(action: {
                       self.selectedColor = .black
                   }) {
                       ColorPicker("Pick Color", selection: $selectedColor)
                           .labelsHidden()
                   }
                   Slider(value: $lineWidth, in: 1...20) {
                       Text("Line Width")
                   }
                   .frame(width: 150)
                   Button(action: {
                       self.lines = []
                   }) {
                       Text("Clear")
                   }
               }
               .padding()

               Canvas { context, size in
                   for line in self.lines {
                       var path = Path()
                       for (i, point) in line.points.enumerated() {
                           if i == 0 {
                               path.move(to: point)
                           } else {
                               path.addLine(to: point)
                           }
                       }
                       context.stroke(path, with: .color(line.color), lineWidth: line.lineWidth)
                   }
                   var currentPath = Path()
                   for (i, point) in self.currentLine.points.enumerated() {
                       if i == 0 {
                           currentPath.move(to: point)
                       } else {
                           currentPath.addLine(to: point)
                       }
                   }
                   context.stroke(currentPath, with: .color(self.currentLine.color), lineWidth: self.currentLine.lineWidth)
               }
               .gesture(
                   DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0.1)
                       .onChanged { value in
                           self.currentLine.points.append(value.location)
                       }
                       .onEnded { _ in
                           self.lines.append(self.currentLine)
                           self.currentLine = Line(points: [], color: self.selectedColor, lineWidth: self.lineWidth)
                       }
               )
               .background(Color.white)
               .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
               .border(Color.black, width: 1)
           }
       }
   }

   struct Line {
       var points: [CGPoint]
       var color: Color = .black
       var lineWidth: CGFloat = 4.0
   }

   struct DrawingCanvas_Previews: PreviewProvider {
       static var previews: some View {
           DrawingCanvas()
       }
   }
   ```

### Update the Main SwiftUI File:

   Modify `ContentView.swift` to use the `DrawingCanvas` view.

   ```swift
   import SwiftUI

   struct ContentView: View {
       var body: some View {
           DrawingCanvas()
       }
   }

   struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
       static var previews: some View {
           ContentView()
       }
   }
   ```

### Update the App Entry Point:

   Ensure your `PaintingApp.swift` file is set to use `ContentView`.

   ```swift
   import SwiftUI

   @main
   struct PaintingApp: App {
       var body: some Scene {
           WindowGroup {
               ContentView()
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Running the App
1. Open the iOS simulator or connect your iOS device.
2. Press the "Run" button (or Cmd + R) in Xcode.
